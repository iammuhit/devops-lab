## Usage

To get started, create a new `Vagrantfile` that points to a docker image:

```bash
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.provider :docker do |d|
    d.image = "hashicorp/consul"
  end
end
```

Then run the virtual machine with the `vagrant up` command:

```bash
vagrant up --provider docker
vagrant status
```

> You must have [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your computer.

### Commands

```bash
vagrant docker-exec -it default -- /bin/sh
```
