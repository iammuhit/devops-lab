## Usage

To get started, create a new `Vagrantfile` that points to a virtual-box. Then you can up the virtual machine with the `vagrant up` command:

```bash
vagrant init -m hashicorp/bionic64
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
vagrant status
```

> You must have [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed on your computer.
